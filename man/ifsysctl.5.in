.SH NAME
ifsysctl[\-\f[CR]<interface name>\f[R]] \- per network interface sysctl
settings
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CR]/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf\f[R]
.PP
\f[CR]/etc/sysctl.conf\f[R]
.PP
\f[CR]/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl\f[R]
.PP
\f[CR]/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl\-<interface name>\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
These files are intended to contain \f[B]sysctl\f[R] settings, that
should be applied when a network interface is created.
This are usually interface specific settings, like:
.IP
.EX
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2
.EE
.PP
or
.IP
.EX
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 0
.EE
.PP
Settings from the global configuration files:
\f[B]\f[BI]/etc/sysctl.d/\f[B].conf\f[R]*, \f[B]/etc/sysctl.conf\f[R]
and \f[B]/etc/sysconfig/network/ifsysctl\f[R] are applied for every
interface created.
.PP
Settings from the \f[B]ifsysctl\-\f[R] file are applied for an
interface, when created, which has the corresponding interface name.
.SH SYNTAX
Wicked writes these settings directly to their corresponding
\f[B]/proc/sys\f[R] locations.
It supports two separator characters for sysctl keywords: a
\[lq]\f[B].\f[R]\[rq] in \f[I]default format\f[R] and a
\[lq]\f[B]/\f[R]\[rq] in the \f[I]alternate format\f[R].
Therefore, the syntax is basically the same as is found in the
/etc/sysctl.conf file.
.PP
Interface names may contain a \[lq]\f[B].\f[R]\[rq].
In the default sysctl format using a \[lq]\f[B].\f[R]\[rq] as separator,
that is any \[lq]\f[B].\f[R]\[rq] in the interface name of the keyword,
has to be replaced with a \[lq]\f[B]/\f[R]\[rq].
In the alternate sysctl format with \[lq]\f[B]/\f[R]\[rq] as separator,
normal interface names can be used.
.PP
\f[I]Note also\f[R], that settings with variables in the global sysctl
files will be applied for every interface!
.PP
Further, files with variables are not compatible to the /etc/sysctl.conf
file.
.SH EXAMPLES
Settings for \[lq]eth0\[rq] and \[lq]eth0.1\[rq] interfaces
.IP
.EX
# using \[dq].\[dq] as separator:
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2
net.ipv6.conf.eth0/1.use_tempaddr = 2

# using \[dq]/\[dq] as separator:
net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use_tempaddr = 2
net/ipv6/conf/eth0.0/use_tempaddr = 2
